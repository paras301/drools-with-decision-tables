# drools-with-decision-tables

This is a spring boot based microservice project. The code here uses drools to execute rules written in excel sheet. Very beneficial when you have team who wants to write business rules separately and then you need a REST API running which can process data and rules.

--v1
Here we'll have schema (POJO) and data inside the project itself. Future versions will have auto-inference of schema using metadata and data to be supplied during REST call.

v1 also refers to an example from https://www.baeldung.com/drools-excel
